* ArQmA
* NINJA

Other cryptos **may** work if the algorithm is the same.

Mining backends:
* **CPU**
* **OpenCL** for AMD GPUs
* **CUDA** for NVIDIA GPUs
<br>
<br>

If you want this to work on arm processor like on Raspberry Pi, you need to build [XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) yourself, do [Custom XMRig](https://github.com/LinuxHeki/XMRiGUI#custom-xmrig) and than [build this](https://github.com/LinuxHeki/XMRiGUI#build-from-source).

If OpenCL doesn't work try to install [this driver](https://github.com/Diolinux/amd-opencl-pro-linux-resolve).

For CUDA to work you need to build [Cuda plugin](http://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-cuda#linux-usage) and put it into `/opt/xmrigui/`

**I NEVER TESTED OPENCL OR CUDA BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT GOOD GPU! PLEASE TEST AND IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG PLEASE REPORT!**
<br>
<br>

Command line options:
* `start` for start mining
* `stop` for stop mining
* `--close` for close window
* `--open` for open window
<br>
<br>

## Build from source

If you want to build XMRiGUI from source, you'll need to have:
* python3
* gtk3
* pyinstaller
<br>
<br>

Build:

`make && sudo make install`

or if you want deb package:

`make && make deb`
<br>
<br>

## Custom XMRig

If you want to use custom version of XMRig you need to replace `xmrig` with the new one and than reinstall XMRiGUI or replace `/opt/xmrigui/xmrig` and restart the app.
